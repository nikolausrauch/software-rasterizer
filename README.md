# CPU Software Rasterizer

A software-rasterizer in C++, that I wrote to get a basic understanding of the OpenGL graphics pipeline.

## Examples

### Minimal setup (colored triangle)

Similar to traditional Graphic APIs we define the input and output of the shader stages, i.e. the data passing through the rasterization pipeline.

All members from `Varying` contained in the `VARYING(...)` macro are interpolated per fragment by the rasterizer.
Note, that it is mandatory to have a `Vec4 position` interpolated attribute.
```cpp
/* vertex data -> input to draw call (via Buffer) */
struct Vertex
{
    Vec3 pos;
    Vec3 color;
};

/*
 * Output of vertex stage, Input to fragment stage
 * -> position is mandatory
 * -> members to interpolate are declared by VARYING macro (member need scalar multiplication, and addition)
*/
struct Varying
{
    Vec4 position;
    Vec3 color;

    VARYING(position, color);
};

/* uniform struct accessable from both "shaders" */
struct Uniforms {};
```
Vertex and fragment shaders are written as function objects which need to be set accordingly with `onVertex` and `onFragment` (currently no default shader).
```cpp
Program<Vertex, Varying, Uniforms> program;
program.onVertex([](const Uniforms& uniform, const Vertex& in, Varying& out)
{
    out.position = Vec4(in.pos, 1.0f);
    out.color = in.color;
});

program.onFragment([](const Uniforms& uniform, const Varying& in, Vec4& out)
{
    out = Vec4(in.color, 1.0f);
});
```

Mesh data is provided to the renderer with a `Buffer` object.

```cpp
Buffer<Vertex> buffer;
buffer.primitive = ePrimitive::TRIANGLES;
buffer.vertices = { { {-0.5, -0.5, 0.5}, {1.0, 0.0, 0.0} },
                    { { 0.5, -0.5, 0.5}, {0.0, 1.0, 0.0} },
                    { { 0.0,  0.5, 0.5}, {0.0, 0.0, 1.0} } };

```
An instance of `Renderer` contains a default framebuffer with a color and depth target.

After clearing the framebuffer, a draw call can be submitted with the previously defined shader program and vertex buffer.

<img src="img/00_triangle.png" align="right" height=250px>

```cpp
/* rasterizer with framebuffer size */
Renderer rasterizer(480, 480);

/* clear framebuffer */
rasterizer.framebuffer().clear(Vec4(0, 0, 0, 1));

/* submit draw call */
rasterizer.draw(program, buffer);

/* save framebuffer as .png */
rasterizer.framebuffer().color().save("00_triangle.png");

```
